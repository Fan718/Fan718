- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fan!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data analytics to solve problems and provide solutions. So I went back to university to pursue a Master's degree in Data Analytics in 2020. This was such an enjoyable and inspiring journey, I've done couple of projects with a strong focus on machine learning algorithms and statistical models, and won the Hackthon competition orgainized by AUT STEM Woman x Electric Kiwi with my friends who studied same program. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m curious of everything related to data, and now I'm picking up some program languages such as Python, Azure clouding systems, Spatical Analysis, etc.
